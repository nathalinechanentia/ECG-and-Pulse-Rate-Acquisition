# ECG-and-Pulse-Rate-Acquisition

This repository contains my submission for the BME4101 Biomedical Instrumentation Mini Project at City University of Hong Kong. The project aims to provide hands-on practice of signal acquisition with various sensors such as PPG and ECG sensor and signal processing.
